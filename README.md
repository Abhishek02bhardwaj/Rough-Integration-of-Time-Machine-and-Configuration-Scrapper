# Rough-Integration-of-Time-Machine-and-Configuration-Scrapper
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This repository is my submission for task #T332643 where we had to integrate the configuration scrapper developed in task #T331201 and the time machine developed in task #T331202.
<h2>Usage</h2>
1. Clone the cxserver repository from <a href = "https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-services-cxserver">Here</a> or by using the given command<br>
 `git clone https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/mediawiki/services/cxserver`
2. Clone this repository on your local system using `git clone`
3. Copy the main.py file in the config directory of the cxserver directory. And execute the file. The output will be generated by the name "data_history_new.csv".
<h2>Output</h2>
The output files were too big to upload so for now I am uploading them here through a google drive link.<br>
